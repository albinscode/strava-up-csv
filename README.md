A strava CLI small program
==========================

It was really boring losing time to turn on my GPS.
And boring to enter manually each recurrent workout.
This is because my workouts are mainly commuting workouts so no challenge :)

Now I can provide my whole week with one single command.

    index.js -a "trajet bl" -s 20161024 -e 20161027

Or for one single day when I'm going back to my company :

    index.js -a "trajet agence" -s 20161024 -e 20161024

No hard work here but no more losing time on strava web site :)

@See `conf/configuration.json` to configure properly your recurrent workouts.
